# Artificial Intelligence - Planning and Replanning using PDDL
Project done as part of the course Artificial Intelligence.
We modelled the game Overcooked as a PDDL optimisation using a temporal planner, TFD, to solve the problems. To simulate the game environment, we modeled the environment in three different ways, object-based domain, quantity-based domain (Numeric Fluents) and object-as-container domain.
